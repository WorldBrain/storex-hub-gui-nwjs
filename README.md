# NW.js based GUI for Storex Hub

The only reason this package exists is to have an easy way of running Storex Hub in the background, restarting it on boot and have a system tray icon to close it again. However, it'd be great if some better solution could be found.

# Usage

- Clone this repository run `npm install` in it
- Get the NW.js binary https://nwjs.io/
- Run `/path/to/nw .`
